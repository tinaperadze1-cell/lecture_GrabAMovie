# 2025-11-24 Update

## Highlights
- Created initial project structure with separate `backend` and `frontend` folders.
- Set up an Express server exposing a `/api/health` endpoint for quick connectivity tests.
- Bootstrapped a Vite + React frontend that can ping the backend and display its status.
- Established the `docs` directory to host future feature backlogs, architecture notes, and daily updates.
- Defined the GRABAMOVIE concept, drafted `features.md` + `architecture.md`, and built the initial hero + movie rating UI with placeholder data.
- Reworked the entire desktop layout into a split hero grid and wide rating dashboard with the retro minimalist palette (black, blue accents, gold highlights) sized to fit within a 1920x1080 frame.
- Added a front-door sign-in screen with demo credentials to gate access to the movie experience.
- **Migrated all hardcoded data to PostgreSQL database (Neon)**: Created `movies` and `users` tables, seeded with initial data. Backend now serves `/api/movies` and `/api/login` endpoints. Frontend fetches movies and authenticates via API instead of using hardcoded values.

## Next Focus
- Define the concrete project idea so we can draft the long-term feature backlog document.
- Capture the high-level architecture based on the agreed idea.
- Begin implementing the first real feature increment once the above documents exist.
