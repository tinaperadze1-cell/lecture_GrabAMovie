# Feature Backlog (GRABAMOVIE)

This list is a living reference for future enhancements. We will cherry-pick from it as our learning plan grows.

## Core Experience
- Landing hero describing the product vision (DONE 2025-11-24).
- Browseable movie list with per-movie rating control (initial version DONE 2025-11-24).
- Search/filter movies by title, genre, or year.
- Persist ratings per user (introduce authentication + database later).
- Show average community ratings once persistence exists.

## Discovery & Content
- Pull real movie data from a public API (TMDB/OMDb) instead of hardcoded entries.
- Highlight trending / top-rated movies.
- Support watchlists or "favorites".

## Social & Gamification
- User profiles with activity history.
- Comments or short reviews for each movie.
- Badges or streaks for frequent raters.

## Operations & Quality
- Responsive layout with accessibility pass.
- Automated tests (unit + component + integration).
- Deployment pipeline (frontend hosting + backend API).
- Analytics/telemetry dashboard for usage insights.

We will revisit and re-order items as the project evolves.*** End Patch}>>>>>
