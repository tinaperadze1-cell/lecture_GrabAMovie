# Lecture Project Tina

This repo is a learning playground for building a simple full-stack application with a Node.js backend and a React frontend. We will iterate slowly, focusing on one feature at a time.

## Getting Started

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install        # only needed the first time
npm run dev        # starts http://localhost:4000 with Nodemon
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install        # only needed the first time
npm run dev        # starts http://localhost:5173 (or another Vite port)
```

Visit the frontend app and use the "Ping backend API" button to confirm both servers are running.

## Docs

All documentation lives under `docs/`. Once the project idea is agreed upon we will add:
- `features.md` – long-term feature backlog (internal reference).
- `architecture.md` – high-level technical plan.
- `YYYY-MM-DD_UPDATE.md` – running log of each working session (already started).
